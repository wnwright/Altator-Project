# ðŸŒ€ Altator: Miniature Toroidal Plasma Demonstrator

**Altator** is a student-designed, tabletop toroidal plasma device created at MITâ€™s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). Inspired by the heritage of Alcator Câ€‘Mod, this transparent-glass tokamak provides a vivid, safe, and interactive way to showcase how plasmas are confined in toroidal magnetic fields.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Objectives

- **Educational Outreach**: Brings plasma physics to public audiences by visibly displaying glowing plasma in a transparent vessel.  
- **Hands-On Training**: Immerses graduate students in systems- and project-level fusion engineering.  
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Demonstrates practical fusion technologiesâ€”RF coupling, vacuum systems, and magnet designâ€”in a small-scale, replicable format.
